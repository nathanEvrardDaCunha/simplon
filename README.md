Simplon is about creating a "Component library".
For that you need to create and merge a "Behavior Library" with a "Style System".
One is responsible for the opinionated "logic" of your components.
The other is responsible for the opinionated "style" of your components.

Start with either the "logic" or "style" side.
Then when you have finished it, switch to the next one.

Don't forget:

-   Respect the rule of 3.
-   Simplicity over Reusability.
-   Be opinionated.

Build real page to test your components, with fake data, like Retroplace.

Make it private on github for now.
